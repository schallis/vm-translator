# VM Translator (from Nand2Tetris Part II Unit 7)

This is my implementation of a VM Translator for the Hack computer to fulfill the requirements of the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course) course. This VM is written in Go and translates Hack VM files into Assembly code that is then assembled by my [Hack Assembler](https://github.com/schallis/hack-assembler) also built during the course.

The specification is described [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project07) and
